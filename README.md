## Install

```
$ npm install -g pullstart
```


## Usage

After installing PullStart globally, cd into your React project and into the directory where you'd like to add either your new Redux "service" or React Component and simply type `pullstart`.  Then you'll select what you'd like to create and name it (Do not use spaces).

## Examples

Take a gander in the examples directory to get an idea of what is generated.
